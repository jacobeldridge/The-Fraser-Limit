# The-Fraser-Limit
My high school math teacher had an idea he was working on for one of his master's classes and asked me to create a program to 
graphically display the concept he wanted to show. 

The concept:
- initial: x = a/b + c
- per iteration: x = x/b + c
- convergance: cb/b-1

As the program iterates from definitions for initial values of a, b, and c, the value of x will converge
to cb/b-1.
